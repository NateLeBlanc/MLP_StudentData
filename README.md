# MLP_StudentData
<b> Description </b>

The purpose of this project is to apply a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a student academic performance data.
The MLP is able to identify if the student are in Lower, Middle, or Higher levels of education based on there performance in the classroom.
The MLP has an input layer of 4 nodes, a hidden layer of 10 nodes, an output layer of 3 nodes. 
There is an 80% percent accuracy to the testing dataset once trained with the training dataset.
The attributes tested and trained for the MLP are number of times the student; raises their hand, visted resources, veiwed annoucesments,
and give discussion in the classroom.
